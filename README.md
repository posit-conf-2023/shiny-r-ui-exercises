<!-- badges: end -->

Goal: shinyMons2 is a pokemon app displaying information related to the
151 first pokemons (first gen). Your mission, should you accept it, will
be to redesign this app currently suffering from some UX issues,
following the best practices learnt during our workshop. Fear not! We’ll
proceed step by step…

This project is hosted on Posit Cloud in this
[space](https://posit.cloud/spaces/400773/join?access_code=ajwkws91bhF-IhEXDVWH9-0mukSUF3jiETCkzrgt).

## Work instructions

Each one of you will be working in a group, an ID will be assigned to
you prior to the workshop. Group leads will be randomly assigned prior
to the workshop and communicated to you. Therefore, only one
person/group will have to commit the code to GitHub.

1.  Group lead: Create a new branch named `<group_ID>` (1 per group!).
2.  Anyone: Run `renv::restore()`.
3.  Explore `poke_data`.
4.  Move to `fresh-start` branch to start completing the workshop
    instructions. They are indicated by `WORKSHOP TODO` in the
    `./R/mod_poke_*` files.

Note: remember that you can run `styler::style_pkg()` and
`devtools::lint()` so the code style stays consistent.

### Part 1 Layout

- Wireframing.
- bslib layout.

### Part 2 colors and typo

- bslib color palette.
- Contrasts tuning.
- Dark/light mode?

### Part 3 interactions

- Sanitize failing functions.
- Handle slow functions.
- Better help messages.

## App structure

This app leveraging `{golem}` is composed of 7 modules. The main module
is `mod_poke_select`, which returns the selected Pokemon (picker input)
as well as its variant (shiny or not). Those data are passed to other
modules. General Pokemon data, namely `poke_data`, have been
pre-processed for you so you don’t have to focus on the data wrangling
but the UI design (This also avoids us to flood the underlying API with
too many requests).

If you’re more curious, browse to `inst/app-doc` and have a look to:

- `data-doc.html`: htmlwidget showing the data structure for the first
  pokemon, so you get an idea on what is available to you.
- `flow`: app module structure, powered by
  [`{flow}`](https://github.com/moodymudskipper/flow).
- `reactlog`: app reactivity log explorator, powered by
  [`{reacltlog}`](https://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of shinyMons2 like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("RinteRface/posit-conf-2023-exercise")
```

### Package dependencies

Right after cloning the repository, don’t forget to restore the R
packages dependencies by doing:

``` r
renv::restore()
```

## Example

To run the app, source `./app.R`.
